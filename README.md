# Random-chinese-flash-card
Very simple chinese, pinyin flash card.

It extracts data from CSV files of HSK level found on internet.


I used Geektool to show result on Desktop.

2 "geeklet":
- one for chinese with big font size
- the other for pinyin and translation with smaller font size


See images for result examples


I search for CSV data but not only words, I want sentences and different files with HSK level (like for words).
